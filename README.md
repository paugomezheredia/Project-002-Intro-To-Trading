## Generating environment to run project

To execute this project correctly we need to create a virtual envitonment (venv) and use the versions and libraries stated in the 'requirements.txt'. Use the following steps to do so:

1.- Create your venv locally:

    - for Mac / Linux users: python3 -m venv venv

    - for Windows users: py -m venv venv

2.- Activate your venv:

    - for Mac / Linux users: source venv/bin/activate

    - for Windows users: .\venv\Scripts\Activate

💡 Tip: When activated, you’ll see '(venv)' at the beginning of your terminal line, which means you’re now working inside the virtual environment.

3.- Install 'requirements.txt':

    - for all OS users: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running Project
    
1.- Run Project from terminal:

    - for Mac / Linux users: python main.py

    - for Windows users: py main.py

As an outpur we obtain the metrics of the project's final results.
