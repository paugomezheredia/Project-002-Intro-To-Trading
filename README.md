# Project-002-Intro-To-Trading
This project develops and tests automated trading strategies for Bitcoin using technical indicators. It aims to find reliable buy and sell signals, include transaction costs, and other trading signals. The strategies are evaluated with historical BTCUSDT data using key financial performance metrics.

To execute this project correctly we need to create a virtual envitonment (venv) and use the versions and libraries stated in the 'requirements.txt'. Use the following steps to do so:

1.- Create your venv locally:
    - for Mac / Linux users: python3 -m venv venv
    - for Windows users: py -m venv venv

2.- Activate your venv:
    - for Mac / Linux users: source venv/bin/activate
    - for Windows users: .\venv\Scripts\Activate

ðŸ’¡ Tip: When activated, youâ€™ll see '(venv)' at the beginning of your terminal line, which means youâ€™re now working inside the virtual environment.

3.- Install 'requirements.txt':
    - for all OS users: pip install -r requirements.txt
